## Cancellation Policy

Bioconductor is	a non-profit organization, and conferences are
designed only to break even every year. As a result we are generally
unable to offer individual refunds.

In light of uncertainty caused by COVID-19, there is the possibility
of a change in format or date of the BioC2020 conference. If this
happens, anyone already registered will be offered the option of a
refund.
